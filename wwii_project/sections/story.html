          <p>Nearly all of the people that join the Kamikaze end up dying for their country. However, a few people were able to escape their fate and continue living their lives. Hisao Horiyama who was part of the Kamikaze force ended up surviving. At the time of the war he was 21 and knew how to fly a plane. One day he received a white piece of paper that he had three options: to volunteer willingly, to simply volunteer, or to say no. He knew the consequences if he refused so he agreed to fly his plane into the side of a US warship. He was originally a soldier in an artillery unit of the Japanese army but eventually got drafted in the Air Force. After he finished his training the emperor visited his unit on a horse. His group thought that the emperor was directly requesting their services so none of them ended up refusing. After he accepted, Horiyama was asked to write a will and a letter. It would be sent to his parents after he completed the mission. Horiyama says that he was a disrespectful child and got poor grades while he was in school. In his letter, he told his father that he was sorry for being a bad student and for crashing three planes during training. He also apologized that the war was turning against their country. He wanted to prove himself to his father and that was the reason that he joined the Kamikaze. His mother was upset. She told him that she would never forgive his father if he died in a kamikaze attack. Japan commenced suicide missions up until the moment they surrendered. On the 15th of August in 1945, there was a radio announcement. Horiyama could not hear it very well because of the static however, he knew one thing was certain. There was somebody who was crying loudly. From this he knew that they lost the war. Japan had surrendered after a nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Horiyama felt bad that he ended up not being able to sacrifice himself for his country. He felt that he left everyone down.</p>
          <p>Not everyone had the same mindset that Horiyama had. Another person who survived the Kamikaze attacks is Takehiko Ena.  When Ena learned that he was chosen to fly in a suicide mission he had a different reaction. He felt the blood drain from his face. Him and the other pilots congratulated each other when they all found out. He thought this was strange because this was not something that he wanted to celebrate. They were all going to die. Before Ena had to serve he was a economics student at a prestigious university in Tokyo. The war took that opportunity from him. He was to pilot a crew of three that were aboard a plane with a 800kg bomb that was strapped to the under cage. The plane also only had fuel for a one way fight so if they could not find their target it was over for him. He was part of Operation Kikusui, a mission against an allied ship during the Battle of Okinawa which was one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific. On April 28th, 1945,  he steered his plane along the runway but failed to go airborne. His second attempt also ended in failure when his engine trouble forced him to make an emergency landing at an army base. He was still carrying the bomb intended for the enemy when he did this. Two weeks later he was on May 11th, he made his third attempt . He told himself that he was doing this for his country and he was chosen to make this sacrifice. He also just wanted to protect his mother and father. While flying, the engine started to give out and him and the people he was with got stuck out at sea. They swam to the nearby island of Kuroshima where they stayed for two and a half months before they were picked up by a submarine. Shortly after this Japan surrendered from the war. Ena was lucky that this happened at just the right time. He ended up not losing his life in a suicide bombing mission. Becoming a member of the Kamikaze pretty much guaranteed death. However, a few lucky survivors lived to tell their stories.</p>
