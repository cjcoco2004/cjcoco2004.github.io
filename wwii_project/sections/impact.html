          <p>The impact that the Kamikaze caused on World War II is symbolic and simple. The Kamikaze represents the deadliness of World War II. They are a perfect example of the extreme violence that occured. The Kamikaze caused a lot of damage to the allies as well as a lot of damage to Japan itself. A lot of deaths were caused by this force. The allies had many of their ships sunk which caused them to lose a valuable resource. The allies also lost a lot of men which could have contributed more to the war. Japan lost a lot of men and planes which would end up causing their military to become even weaker than it was before they started using the Kamikaze. The Kamikaze also show an extreme case of how Nationalism can get out of hand. People willingly threw their lives away for their country which shows that Nationalism can become something that is not right and cause many people to die. </p>
